# 0x16. API advanced

## Background Context

Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for?
How to use an API with pagination?
How to parse JSON results from an API?
How to make a recursive API call?
How to sort a dictionary by value?

## Tasks

**0. How many subs?**
Write a function that queries the R API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit.

**1. Top Ten**
Write a function that queries the R API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subR.

**2. Recurse it!**
Write a recursive function that queries the R API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subR.
