#0x0C. Web server

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)

Tips: to test your answer Bash script, feel free to reproduce the checker environment:

start an ubuntu:16.04 Docker container
run your script on it
see how it behaves
Check out the Docker concept page for more info about how to manipulate containers.
